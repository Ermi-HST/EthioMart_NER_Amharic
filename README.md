# EthioMart_NER_Amharic

### Task 1: Data Ingestion and Preprocessing
#### Data Ingestion:

successfully built a script to scrape messages from multiple Telegram channels and store them in CSV format (telegram_messages.csv).
✅ Completed.

#### Data Preprocessing:

implemented text preprocessing, cleaning the raw Telegram messages (e.g., removing punctuation, normalizing text).
The preprocessed data is saved in a new file (preprocessed_telegram_messages.csv).
✅ Completed.
### Task 2: Labeling and Preparing the Dataset
### Label a Subset of Data (AAutomatically labeling for NER):

this step of labeling 30-50 messages in CoNLL format to identify entities like products, prices, and locations. This is needed to create a training set for NER.
✅ Completed .
### Fine-Tuning the NER Model:

finished with fine-tuning the model. I used the labeled dataset to fine-tune a pre-trained model (e.g., XLM-Roberta) for Amharic NER.
✅ Completed.
